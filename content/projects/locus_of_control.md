This research project investigates whether Locus of Control, a psychological
measure for a person's belief of having control over the outcomes in their own
lives, is malleable. We use the GSOEP (German Socio-Economic Panel) from
2005-2015 and estimate in a difference-and-difference design the changes in
Locus of Control due to potentially exogenous and negative events like death of
a close relative. The reasoning is that sudden, negative events raise the
salience of lack of power which might push the individual towards a more
external Locus of Control. External in contrast to internal Locus of Control
means that the individual believes outcomes cannot be controlled by the
individual whereas internal means the opposite.
