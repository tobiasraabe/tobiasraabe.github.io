### Research

#### Identification Strategies for Software Patents (2015 - 2018)

This project deals with the identification of software patents and combines
multiple approaches from simple algorithms (see [@Bessen2007]) to novel machine
learning models to achieve its goal.

The origin of this project was a Bachelor's thesis, but now the main purpose is
to be a playground for machine learning techniques and deep learning with
textual data.

#### Malleability of Locus of Control (2017)

This research project is concerned with a person's Locus of Control which is
the degree to which people believe that they have control over the outcome of
events in their lives. We use the GSOEP (German Socio-Economic Panel) from
2005-2015 and estimate in a difference-and-difference design the changes in
Locus of Control due to potentially exogenous and negative events like death of
a close relative. The reasoning is that sudden, negative events raise the
salience of lack of power which might push the individual towards a more
external Locus of Control. External in contrast to internal Locus of Control
means that the individual believes outcomes cannot be controlled by the
individual whereas internal means the opposite.

#### Cryptocurrency Market Prediction (2017)

The project is about market prediction in cryptocurrency markets like Potcoin
and was developed during a programing class for economists which focused on the
embedding of the research project in a Waf framework. Waf is an automation tool
for software design.

### Software Engineering

#### oTree Virtual Machine Manager (2017 - 2018)

This tool is designed to handle many administrative tasks on a server with
multiple running oTree instances. In addition to that, a collection of virtual
machine images are provided based on the host's performance and administrator's
needs.
