### cookiecutter-research-template (2018-2019)

[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) is a tool to quickly
generate project templates of any kind. This template for reproducible research
is based on Gaudecker's template for reproducible economic research enhanced
with some useful tools from software engineering to help newcomers to write
better Python code.

### Time Series (2018)

This project comprises the content of a time series analysis course. There is a
theoretical section and problems sets with implementations in Julia. If you
want to give it a try yourself, you can follow the Binder badges where you can
code online in your browser without installing Julia on your system.

### Identification Strategies for Software Patents (2015 - 2018)

This project deals with the identification of software patents and combines
multiple approaches from simple algorithms (see [@Bessen2007]) to novel machine
learning models to achieve its goal.

The origin of this project was a Bachelor's thesis, but now the main purpose is
to be a playground for machine learning techniques and deep learning with
textual data.

### oTree Virtual Machine Manager (2017 - 2018)

This tool is designed to handle many administrative tasks on a server with
multiple running oTree instances. In addition to that, a collection of virtual
machine images are provided based on the host's performance and administrator's
needs.

### Malleability of Locus of Control (2017)

This research project is concerned with a person's Locus of Control which is
the degree to which people believe that they have control over the outcome of
events in their lives. We use the GSOEP (German Socio-Economic Panel) from
2005-2015 and estimate in a difference-and-difference design the changes in
Locus of Control due to potentially exogenous and negative events like the
death of a close relative. The reasoning is that sudden, negative events raise
the salience of lack of power which might push the individual towards a more
external Locus of Control. External in contrast to internal Locus of Control
means that the individual believes outcomes cannot be controlled by the
individual whereas internal means the opposite.

### Cryptocurrency Market Prediction (2017)

The project is about market prediction in cryptocurrency markets like Potcoin
and was developed during a programming class for economists which focused on the
embedding of the research project in a Waf framework. Waf is an automation tool
for software design.
