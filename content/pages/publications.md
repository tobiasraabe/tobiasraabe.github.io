**Early Identification of College Dropouts Using Machine-Learning: Conceptual
Considerations and an Empirical Example (2019)**

published in IZA Research Report No. 89.*

Can and should we use modern big data methods to predict which students will drop out of
their studies? Such an early detection of at-risk groups of students would allow
practitioners and policy-makers to timely intervene through targeted counter-measures as
for instance mentoring, counseling, or institutional support. This report discusses the
feasibility, benefits and potential hidden costs of such an approach which would allow
to mitigate substantial costs of educational career frictions.
