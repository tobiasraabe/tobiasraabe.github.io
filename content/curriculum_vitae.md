   Identification Strategies for Software Patents </span><br>
<span style="color: grey; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic">Linking
patents to industries is crucial to determine the flow of knowledge,
to analyse where patents are used and why. But patents are not easy to classify
in topics which researcher are interested in like related to software or
certain types of drugs. The patent classification system is structured by
function and sorts a water dispenser, pistol, and a manure spreader in the same
group. The thesis replicates a word-based, hand-coded, boolean algorithm and
proposes a machine learning strategy to overcome the problem of manual
classification of patents which is infeasible due to amount of data.</span>
