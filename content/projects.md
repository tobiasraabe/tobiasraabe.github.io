        of Locus of Control</a><br>
        <span style="color: grey; font-style: italic; font-size: 14px">
            This research project investigates whether Locus of Control, a
            psychological measure for a person's belief of having control over
            the outcomes in their own lives, is malleable. We use the GSOEP
            (German Socio-Economic Panel) from 2005-2015 and estimate in a
            difference-and-difference design the changes in Locus of Control
            due to potentially exogenous and negative events like death of a
            close relative. The reasoning is that sudden, negative events raise
            the salience of lack of power which might push the individual
            towards a more external Locus of Control. External in contrast to
            internal Locus of Control means that the individual believes
            outcomes cannot be controlled by the individual whereas internal
            means the opposite.

        oTree Virtual Machine Manager (ovmm)</a><br>
        <span style="color: grey; font-style: italic; font-size: 14px">
            This tool is designed to handle many administrative tasks on a
            server with multiple running oTree instances. In addition to that,
            multiple virtual machine images are provided based on the hosts
            performance and administrator's needs.
